# Interactive-Visualization-Challenge

## Problem:
Data regarding population of bacteria breeding in belly buttons has been collected and stored in a json file.  It is difficult to read / access.  The data needs to be made viewable so that researchers can access and interpret the data.

## Solution:
Using a combination of HTML, Bootstrap, Plotly and JavaScript an interface was created to interact with the data, visualizing the data for comparison.
