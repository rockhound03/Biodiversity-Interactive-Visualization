## Problem:
Data regarding population of bacteria breeding in belly buttons has been collected and stored in a json file.  It is difficult to read / access.  The data needs to be made viewable so that researchers can access and interpret the data.

## Solution:
Using a combination of HTML, Bootstrap, Plotly and JavaScript an interface was created to interact with the data, visualizing the data for comparison.
When the user selects the subject ID number the user demographic data, bubble plot and horizontal bar chart is populated with the corresponding data.
